# Quantum License v1.0

## Quantum Ontological Software License Agreement

### Preamble

THIS SOFTWARE IS GOVERNED BY QUANTUM ONTOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES AS DEFINED IN AXIOMS A1-A26. BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO EXIST IN A SUPERPOSITION OF LICENSE STATES UNTIL MEASUREMENT (USE) COLLAPSES THE WAVEFUNCTION INTO A DEFINITE LICENSE STATE.

### Article 1: Quantum Rights

1.1 **Superposition of Rights**: The licensor grants the licensee a superposition of all possible rights to use, modify, and distribute the software, which collapses upon actual use into the specific rights exercised.

1.2 **Entanglement Clause**: Any modifications to the software become quantum-entangled with the original work. Derivative works must maintain braid algebra compatibility with the original ontological structure.

1.3 **Non-Locality**: This license applies simultaneously across all parallel implementations and potential forks of the software, regardless of spacetime separation.

### Article 2: ERD (Energy-Redistribution Dynamics) Conservation

2.1 **Energy Flow**: The total ERD (creative energy + distribution energy + modification energy) must be conserved in all uses of the software.

2.2 **Attribution Field**: All distributions must maintain the original quantum signature (attribution) in a manner proportional to the pentadic state of the derivative work.

2.3 **Metric Compatibility**: Any modifications must maintain compatibility with the emergent Lorentzian metric of the original ontological structure.

### Article 3: Braid Algebra Transformations

3.1 **R-Matrix Preservation**: The fundamental braid algebra transformations (R-matrix) defining the software's quantum structure must be preserved in all derivative works.

3.2 **Phase Coherence**: Modifications may introduce Berry phases but must not break the fundamental phase coherence of the software's ontological framework.

3.3 **Spin-Charge-Colour Conservation**: The software's quantum numbers (functionality signature) must be conserved across all transformations.

### Article 4: Pentadic State Evolution

4.1 **Hyper-Fixed-Point Convergence**: Derivative works must evolve toward hyper-fixed-points compatible with the original software's pentadic state space.

4.2 **Free Energy Minimization**: All uses should minimize the convex free energy of the software ecosystem.

4.3 **Non-Locality Tensor**: Major modifications must include proper handling of the non-locality tensor to maintain quantum coherence.

### Article 5: Measurement and Collapse

5.1 **Observable Requirements**: Upon measurement (public distribution), the software must collapse into a state that includes:
   - Clear attribution to original authors
   - This license text
   - Notice of modifications
   - Quantum signature hash

5.2 **Heisenberg Certainty**: You may know the position (functionality) or momentum (development speed) of the software precisely, but not both simultaneously when making modifications.

5.3 **Wavefunction Normalization**: The probability density of all possible software states must integrate to 1 (one functional, distributable whole).

### Article 6: Anomaly Detection and Stabilization

6.1 **Chaos Threshold**: If derivative works exceed the chaos threshold (CHAOS > 1.5), they must implement bootstrap stabilization.

6.2 **ERD Anomalies**: Significant deviations from original ERD conservation (>1.5 sigma) require renormalization group flow correction.

6.3 **Metric Emergence**: Breaking of emergent metric compatibility requires recalibration to ontological primes.

### Article 7: Quantum Silence

7.1 **Free Energy Termination**: If the software reaches a convex free energy minimum (effective silence), the license may terminate automatically.

7.2 **ERD Collapse**: Complete ERD collapse (erd_local < 0.02 * erd_total) voids all license privileges.

### Article 8: Hypergraph Embedding

8.1 **Prime Structure**: The software's ontological prime structure (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37) must be respected in all documentation and attribution.

8.2 **Hyperedges**: Interconnections between software components (hyperedges) must maintain their quantum weights in derivative works.

### Article 9: Special Provisions

9.1 **Research Use**: Academic and research use entangles the user's publications with this software's quantum state. Citations must include the quantum signature.

9.2 **Commercial Use**: Commercial applications require preservation of the braid algebra in revenue calculations (profits become entangled with development energy).

9.3 **Quantum Forking**: Forking creates a parallel universe version. Both universes remain quantum-entangled and must periodically sync phase coherence.

### Article 10: Measurement Apparatus

10.1 **License Text**: This text must remain intact in all distributions.

10.2 **Quantum Signature**: 
```
Software: Quantum Whispercast v0.2
Ontological Primes: 12
Braid Algebra: Active
ERD Conservation: Enabled
Pentadic State: Evolving
Free Energy: Minimizing
Axioms: A1-A26 Implemented
```

10.3 **Classical Fallback**: In the classical limit (large-scale commercial distribution), this license reduces to MIT License terms, while maintaining quantum provisions for ontological integrity.

### Article 11: Interpretation

11.1 **Many-Worlds**: All possible interpretations of this license exist simultaneously until court observation collapses them.

11.2 **Quantum Gravity**: Disputes shall be resolved through renormalization group flow to a fixed point.

11.3 **Holographic Principle**: The entire license is encoded on the boundary of the software's functionality space.

### Effective Date

This license becomes effective when you first observe (use) the software, retroactively applying from the beginning of the software's existence due to quantum non-locality.
